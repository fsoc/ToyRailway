# ToyRailway
Nora is playing with her toy railway. Her railroad network consists of a number of railroad switches connected by tracks. As the network starts to be rather complex, she needs some help with the traffic planning. Write a program that determines how each switch should be set in order for Noraâ€™s train to make the shortest possible loop and return to the starting position.
